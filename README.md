# Statistics-Review
MITx - MicroMasters Program on Statistics and Data Science - Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications - First Project 

The first project of the MIT MicroMasters Program course on Data Analysis focused on a review of key statistical concepts
related to performing research with empirical data. The concepts covered on how to design research experiments
to how to conduct hypothesis testing in complicated problems. 

This included being able to discuss the effectiveness of an experimental design, by understanding the different elements
such as placebo effect, double-blindness and which test statistic measures the treatment effect and the potential biases
in this test statistic.

Furthermore, being able to understand and apply multiple hypothesis testing that includes a statistical model for the data and
the hypothesis to be tested together with the adequate test statistics. Running the test by understanding the asymptotic distribution
of the test statistic and identifying statistical significance by also incorporating the forms of correction for multiple hypotheses
testing such as Holm-Bonferroni correction and Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

Finally, in the analysis, understanding the mathematics and statistics of p-value and the consequences of these in real applications.

The project included application of statistical methods and models with three different datasets and a written report in a deadline of two weeks of time.

**ACCESSING CODE AND REPORT**

The statistical application of methods and code for the project is made with Jupyter Notebook and the written report is a pdf-file.

The dependencies and requirements can be seen from requirements.txt that can be installed in shell with the command:

      pip install -r requirements.txt
